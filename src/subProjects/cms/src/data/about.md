# Project Purpose

National or regional level initiatives intended to address water quality and quantity issues related to agriculture are typically envisioned and conducted by scientists and experts, while farmers, landowners, rural communities, and other stakeholders often play less central roles.  While stakeholder engagement is increasingly seen as a critical strategy to address complex natural resource issues, research on what behavioral and management changes are attained through the process of engagement, and which strategies are most effective is limited. Designed to address these critical needs, our project seeks to better understand how stakeholders are and can be more effectively engaged in the decisions and programs that affect water quality and quantity for and from agriculture.

# Engagement

It is widely recognized that efforts to address water and agricultural issues frequently lack the assistance, time and resources to effectively listen to, and genuinely incorporate the views of local residents in the development of strategies to address them.  In addition, the organizations, interest groups, and agencies working on these challenges generally have limited opportunities to share information and expertise – much less work collaboratively to seek locally-based solutions.  Lastly, it is often the case that engagement efforts are designed primarily to get the ‘buy-in’ or approval of local stakeholders rather than being a genuinely ‘community-led’ process – effectively empowering stakeholders with the resources and authority they need to lead efforts, prioritize issues and craft solutions to the challenges they consider most important.

The Water for Ag project seeks to address these long-standing issues and learn from the experience of developing a genuinely community-led initiative coordinated through a ten to fifteen-member Local Leadership Team – comprised of representative from a diverse set of local stakeholders including producers, agricultural organizations, service providers, decision-makers, service providers, local governments, agencies and interested residents.
# Research

Throughout all phases of the project, a longitudinal, mixed-methods approach to social and biophysical data collection is being developed to evaluate the effectiveness of community engagement strategies and approaches in different physical, social, economic, and political contexts. Primary research methods include

A pre-and post-engagement data collection design in the six study locations;
assessing social/behavioral effects of stakeholder engagement at the individual, collective and institutional levels; and
assessing biophysical impact through changes in practice implementation and water quantity and quality parameters.
