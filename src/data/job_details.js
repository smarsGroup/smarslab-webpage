The Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing (SMaRS) lab
investigates methods to improve crop modeling capabilities, focusing on
reliably simulating crop growth, carbon, nitrogen, and water interactions at
multiple spatial scales. The lab also develops operational decision support
tools and data products using process-based crop modeling and satellite remote
sensing. The SMaRS lab consists of a team with expertise in spatial data
analysis, satellite remote sensing, crop modeling, high-end computation, crop
physiology, and agronomy.

## Job Summary

The SMARS lab at USDA-ARS, Maricopa, AZ is seeking a Post-Doctorate
Researcher. The researcher will contribute to research activities under a NASA
funded project. The projectâ€™s primary goal is to improve the existing crop
modeling system and implement at a large regional scale to estimate carbon and
nitrogen fluxes in agricultural lands. We are seeking a potential candidate
with expertise in process-based crop modeling and sound knowledge in carbon and
nitrogen dynamics.

## Key Responsibilities

The successful candidate will closely collaborate with a
multidisciplinary team, and he/she will involve in data collection, model
calibration and configuration, model implementation and uncertainty
quantification. The incumbent will communicate with stakeholders involved in
the project, and present outcomes of the project at scientific conferences and
meetings, as well as write reports and publications.

## Minimum Qualifications and Required Skills

 - Applicants should have a Ph.D. or equivalent in agricultural
engineering, agronomy, soil science, ecology, or environmental
science. 
 - Candidates must have demonstrated experience in using and improving
process-based crop models such as Environmental Policy Integrated Climate
(EPIC), Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), DayCENT,
DNDC or equivalent, and have hands-on experience in spatial data processing.
 - Experience and skills in programming languages (e.g. Fortran, C++ and Python/R)
and analytical skills in model evaluation are strongly preferred.

## Job Summary


A postdoctoral researcher position is available for a highly qualified individual to support research activities under NASA SERVIR project. The successful candidate will work with a team of atmospheric and crop modelers at the National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) and USDA-ARS to improve the skill of regional Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts required for in-season crop yield forecasting. Specifically, the candidate will use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to
dynamically downscale global climate model S2S forecasts using both the deterministic and probabilistic modeling approaches. The candidate will also test and evaluate existing global S2S weather forecasts. The candidate will also have an opportunity to visit NSF NCAR to work with the collaborators.

## Key Responsibilities

The primary focus of this project is to create a web-based rice yield forecasting system for Nepal to produce crop conditions and yield outlooks at the administrative level. The candidate will be welcome to explore any research questions related to crop yield forecasting at regional and national scales. The postdoc will be expected
to maintain a strong record of scholarly publication and presentations at scientific conferences and public meetings.

## Minimum Qualifications and Required Skills

 - Advanced knowledge of multi-scale deterministic and probabilistic numerical weather predictions at scales ranging from short-range (a few days) to S2S. 
 - Advanced skill in scientific programming languages such as Python, Matlab, R, IDL, Fortran, Perl, C/C++.
 - Demonstrated skill in WRF modeling from idealized to real-world.
 - Skill in analyzing meteorological datasets and model products.
 - Familiarity with high performance computing.
 - Demonstrated ability to produce focused results in a project environment.
 - Demonstrated skill in working within diverse scientific and technical teams, including across institutions.
 - Strong skills in written and oral communication of research results.
 - Demonstrated ability in software development and testing.
