The Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing (SMaRS) lab
investigates methods to improve crop modeling capabilities, focusing on
reliably simulating crop growth, carbon, nitrogen, and water interactions at
multiple spatial scales. The lab also develops operational decision support
tools and data products using process-based crop modeling and satellite remote
sensing. The SMaRS lab consists of a team with expertise in spatial data
analysis, satellite remote sensing, crop modeling, high-end computation, crop
physiology, and agronomy.

## Job Summary

The SMARS lab at USDA-ARS, Maricopa, AZ is seeking a Post-Doctorate
Researcher. The researcher will contribute to research activities under a NASA
funded project. The projectâ€™s primary goal is to improve the existing crop
modeling system and implement at a large regional scale to estimate carbon and
nitrogen fluxes in agricultural lands. We are seeking a potential candidate
with expertise in process-based crop modeling and sound knowledge in carbon and
nitrogen dynamics.

## Key Responsibilities

The successful candidate will closely collaborate with a
multidisciplinary team, and he/she will involve in data collection, model
calibration and configuration, model implementation and uncertainty
quantification. The incumbent will communicate with stakeholders involved in
the project, and present outcomes of the project at scientific conferences and
meetings, as well as write reports and publications.

## Minimum Qualifications and Required Skills

 - Applicants should have a Ph.D. or equivalent in agricultural
engineering, agronomy, soil science, ecology, or environmental
science. 
 - Candidates must have demonstrated experience in using and improving
process-based crop models such as Environmental Policy Integrated Climate
(EPIC), Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), DayCENT,
DNDC or equivalent, and have hands-on experience in spatial data processing.
 - Experience and skills in programming languages (e.g. Fortran, C++ and Python/R)
and analytical skills in model evaluation are strongly preferred.
